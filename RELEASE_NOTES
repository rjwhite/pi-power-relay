1.0     June 9, 2018
        - initial version

1.1     June 22, 2018
        - fixed and improved some diagnostic messages
        - added -x|--ping-timeout option to change ping timeout from
          default of 2 seconds
        - added a sdist target in the Makefile

1.2     Oct 28, 2018
         - added a -m|--maint option to specify a known maintenance time
           that your outside network connection will not be available.
           Can be given multiple times.
           During these time periods, do NOT reset the device
        - made main line coding into a main() function and call it if
          __name__ == '__main__'
        - made proper doc-strings for functions instead of traditional
          comments before the function declaration.  (fat lot of
          good it'll do when the command name uses hyphens instead of
          underscores and doesn't end in .py)
        - added example to README.txt and README.md
        - updated man page for -m option.  added missing -x.  fixed stuff.
        - updated version in setup.py

1.3     Aug 12, 2020
        - now works with python version 3,  as well as version 2
        - is_reset_locked():
          changed returns from 0 and 1 to False and True
        - reset_device():
          variable quiet_flag was not available and caused a traceback
          from NameError. made quiet_flag a global
        - logit():
          made smarter in handling exception when open/write fails
        - num_too_big():
          new function created.
          Used to test values for number of ping tries (-t), reset time (-r),
          wait time (-w) and ping timeout (-x)
        - usage():
          complete overhaul.  much easier to read source
        - refactoring:
          line lengths now less than 80 characters.
          some info and error messages changed for shorter line lengths.
          logic changed to effect logging and messaging if force flag is set

2.0     Nov 3, 2023
        COMPLETE OVERHAUL.

        The entire package has been reorganized to utilize modern best
        practices for Python packaging and distribution.  The program has
        now been changed to be a module and uses the main() function as
        an entry point for a wrapper program that imports and calls it.
        It is no longer using setup() and disttools, but instead has pip
        as the front-end for a build, and uses a back-end of hatchling,
        as defined in the pyproject.toml file.  

        - added option -L/--lockfile option
        - added --dns-hosts to be accepted along with -H and --hosts
          for better clarity
        - added default dns host of 8.8.4.4 to go along with 8.8.8.8
        - functions moved to a separate module.  A lot of refactoring.
